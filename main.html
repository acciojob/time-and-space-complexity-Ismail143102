  <h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the input size. A good algorithm has low time complexity and is considered efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with input size.
